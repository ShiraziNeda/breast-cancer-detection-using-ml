# breast_cancer_detection_project
# Title:
Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

# Overview:
This project leverages the breast_cancer dataset from sklearn to detect breast cancer. Multiple machine learning models are trained, evaluated, and compared to identify the best-performing model.

# Key Features:
Data preprocessing (splitting, normalization).

# Training and testing of various classification models:

Naive Bayes,
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Decision Tree,
Random Forest,
Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression,
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
Visual comparison of model performances.

# Technologies Used:
Python

# Libraries: 
Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy

# Results:
Comparison of accuracy, precision, and recall for all models:

# Visualizations:
Bar charts comparing accuracy, precision, and recall for all models.
